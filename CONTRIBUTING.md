# Contributing

`cloud-itonami-9700` accepts contributions to the OSS blueprint, capability
bindings, policy tests, documentation and operator model.

## Development
The capability layer lives in `kotoba-lang/robotics` and `kotoba-lang/labor`.
This repo holds the business blueprint and operator contracts.

```bash
clojure -X:test
clojure -M:lint
```

## Rules
- Do not commit real worker, household, payment or credential data.
- Keep robot dispatch, payroll and disclosures behind the Domestic Employment
  Governor.
- Treat domestic-employment workflows as high-risk: add tests for robot-safety
  gating, contract/wage balance, disclosure and audit logging.
- Document any new business-model or operator assumption in `docs/`.

## Pull Requests
PRs should describe: what behavior changed, which policy invariant is
affected, how it was tested, whether operator or certification docs need
updates.
